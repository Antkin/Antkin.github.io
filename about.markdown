Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Anthony Johansen, and on this page I'll tell you a little about me.

I was born in France but raised in the United States for most of my life. Since a young age I've been interested in all things software and technology which led me to pursue a bachelors degree in Software Engineering at McGill University. 

In my free time I like to read, watch sci-fi movies, play videogames, and make cool prints with my 3D printer! 

Favorite Book: Hyperion
